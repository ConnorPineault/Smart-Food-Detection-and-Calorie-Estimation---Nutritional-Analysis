Smart Food Detection and Calorie Estimation with YOLOv8 for Nutritional Analysis




The rise of lifestyle diseases such obesity and diabetes has highlighted the importance/value of accurate and accessible dietary monitoring. However, manual tracking of food intake is time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to poor results in nutrition management. An automated food recognition system offers a solution by leveraging ML and NN to accurately identify food items from photos, and providing estimations of their caloric/nutritional content. We aim to simplify caloric and nutritional tracking and in turn, improve dirty assessments, benefiting both individuals, and healthcare providers. This project showcases the practical use of object deception models in solving everyday challenges related to health and nutrition. This research could pave the way for more sophisticated health monitoring tools, and AI driven solutions in the food industry, hopefully leading to better health outcomes.
